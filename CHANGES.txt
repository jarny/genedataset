# Version number should start with a number, and notes should start with '- '.

2.0 (2015-02-13)
---
- First major upgrade released to production after re-working of the code base due to Nick's departure.

2.1 (2015-02-16)
---
- Gene search by upload is now MUCH faster. Also species can be specified.
- Search can be done on geneset page through input text box.
- User management can be done using the GUI by administrators.
- Fixed a bug where search page did not work if previously used dataset name stored using localStorage didn't match an existing dataset.

2.2 (2015-02-17)
---
- Fixed a bug where simple search did not work.
- Gene search text box directly on expression profile page has been hidden as it's not implemented yet.
- Fixed black colours of CSL-RNASeq dataset.
- Fixed a bug where error page was displayed if a gene was not found in any of the datasets.

2.3 (2015-03-01)
---
- Fixed a bug where having no geneset in history caused internal server error.
- Version number and release notes are now automatically picked up from the code.
- Added Schultze dataset (public).
- Fixed a bug where clicking on the orthologue symbol caused not found error.
- Fixed a bug where differential expression search wasn't working (always returning no genes, due to limma not being installed on server).
- Fixed a bug where differential expression search could sometimes fail due to some probes not matching up with genes in the system.

2.4 (2015-03-06)
---
- Added CSL-InVivoG dataset (only visible to those in CSL group).
- Expression profile page now remembers the last selected dataset and group by and colour by selections for each dataset. (This is still not working 100% though, and hopefully the remaining issues will be resolved in near future).
- Colour by selection in expression profile page is now smart enough to recognise when colour by does not make sense for selected group by.
- Fixed a bug where differential expression search did not work on the hiltonlab dataset.
- Fixed some bad links on the home page.
- Version numbers are now dated, and all version notes can be seen, not just the latest.
- Samples page now shows the table view as default. The table will show sample group columns dynamically when a dataset is selected. (The sort on these columns is not woking properly yet.)

2.5 (2015-03-06)
---
- Lineage colours have been put back into the hiltonlab dataset after they went walkabout.
- Fixed a bug where expression profile page didn't work for genes not found in the selected dataset.

2.6 (2015-03-12)
---
- Added taoudi dataset (only visible to those in HiltonLab group).
- Usage is now logged.
- hilltonlab-rnaseq now has the same lineage colours as hiltonlab dataset.
- Find similar function has been added. Use this to find genes with similar expression profiles in the currently selected dataset.

2.7 (2015-05-26)
---
- Rna-seq datasets will now display RPKM values for expression plots, rather than cpm values.
- Find similar function for a gene/probe on the expression profile page will now use RPKM values for rna-seq datasets.
- The geneset name and description now include gene symbol when viewing correlated genes.
- Geneset page will display description of the geneset when hovering over the geneset name.
- Dataset analysis page now has the option to display t-sne clustering. Minimum spanning tree option has been removed for now, since it wasn't quite working.
- Dataset analysis plot can now zoom and move. The plot also happens only after the run button has been pressed.
- Tables should render better on Firefox now (columns weren't lining up and geneset page didn't paginate properly).
- CSL-SLE dataset has been added. Users in the CSL group should be able to see this.
- Sorting on columns now works on samples page (but only when a dataset has been selected).

2.8 (2015-06-19)
---
- Fixed a bug where MDS plots didn't work for taoudi or watkins datasets.
- Added extra dimensions to mds plot on dataset page.
- Add the ability to select and show subsets of samples in mds and t-sne plots.
- The labels on the mds and t-sne plots are also less crowded, with overlapping duplicate labels not shown.
- There is now a link on datasets page to download the dataset, which will create a zip file containing both the expression data and sample table. Note this operation can take several minutes to complete.
- Fixed a bug on users page (only relevant for admin).
- Converted users and groups from sqlite to h5 (only relevant for developers).

2.9 (2015-07-15)
---
- MDS plot mouseover has been improved.
- Expression values can now be exported.
- The scale on expression plot has been improved. For microarray data, dataset minimum is used to set the minimum value on the axis and help text shows this value. The scale on this axis is also automatically adjusted to avoid exaggerating small variations.

3.0 (2015-07-30)
---
- Search for gene now does takes substrings, so 'bcl11' will bring back 'Bcl11a' for example.
- dmap and immgen datasets have been added (both are publicly accessible datasets).
- About Haemosphere page has been created (click on 'more...' from home page), which contains information about how datasets and genes have been created in the system.
- From About Genes page (/show_about), text files can be downloaded that contain information about all genes in the system.
- Heatmap function has been added. Access this from one of the actions on the geneset page.
- Some of the logos on the home page have improved rendering.
- Hovering on names of saved or history gene sets will show their full name for truncated names.
- Correlation score can now be filtered based on positive or negative correlation on geneset page.
- Orthologue on the geneset now works on the filtered geneset.
