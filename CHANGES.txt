0.1.x: These versions are just minor changes in the package metadata in order to test pypi upload and download.
0.2: Probe to gene id mapping files provided had missing probes for some genes. This has now been fixed.
0.3: Fixed a bug in dataset where missing sample group items could cause an exception when running sampleGroupItems.
0.4: Name of the dataset can now be set by using 'name' key under '/series/attributes' key of the .h5 file. If this key is not present, filename will be used keeping backwards compatibility.
0.5: Updated gene annotations using the latest files. geneset now also includes functions used for updating the annotation.
0.5.1: Fixed a bug in dataset where correlation function could throw an error if zeros were encountered in expression values of rna-seq dataset.
0.5.2: Previous fix still produces a warning in scipy/numpy if the row is all zeros, so fixed this.
0.6: Added extra argument 'addVersionSuffix' to dataset.createDatasetFile() to control addition of version suffix to the filename (default True).
1.0: Major upgrade. Now supports both python 2 and 3. Gene annotation has been upgraded to Ensembl v88. Dataset no longer supports microarrays, so is simplified.
